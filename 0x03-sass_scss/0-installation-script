# Installation of SASS can be seen at the official SASS website

### Installation via CLI

- Make sure you have Node.js already installed. Download it from https://nodejs.org

- Install Sass globally using the following command:

      npm install -g sass

  This downloads the package using Node Package Manager (npm) and installs it globally so it can be used directly from the command line.

- If newer versions exist, further instructions will be given to update to the latest version with an additional command. Example:

      npm install sass -v 3.7.4

  (Note: At the time of this installation, version 3.7.4 does not exist on npm, so the latest available version was installed instead.)

- Check if the installation was successful using:

      sass --version
